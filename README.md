### Thank you for visiting my Github profile! ðŸ‘‹ 
### I am _Ross_, a 25 year old Computer Science teacher currently based in Nottingham, UK :european_castle:.

I studied Computing (BSc) at the University of Leicester and following my graduation, I have moved into teaching Computer Science to students between the ages of 11 and 16. I am currently teaching myself web development in my spare time.

To learn web development, I have been working through 'The Odin Project'. Throughout my journey so far I have been completing several projects which demonstrate my progress and have allowed me to consolidate my knowledge and understanding of the content I have been learning. 

_I am a very reflective learner, I like to take the time to reflect on what went well in a piece of work, what I learned and the challenges that I faced throughout it. For each project I write a project reflection in the README.md of the repository, I have found this technique really helps with my learning process._

Below is a list of the projects I have worked on so far. They have been ordered in terms of projects I am most excited about.

**âš¡ List of projects completed so far (Repositories for projects can be found on my Github profile!):**
1. _Etch-a-Sketch Web Application (Using JavaScript and CSS)_ https://rosstarrant.github.io/etch-a-sketch/
