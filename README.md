### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

To learn web development, I have been working through 'The Odin Project'. Throughout my journey so far I have been completing several projects which demonstrate my progress and have allowed me to consolidate my knowledge and understanding of the content taught. Below are two lists of the projects I have worked on so far, they have been ordered in terms of projects I am most excited about.

**âš¡ List of projects completed so far (Repositories for projects can be found on my Github profile!):**
1. _Landing Page (Using HTML/CSS/Flexbox)_ https://rosstarrant.github.io/Landing-Page/
2. _Rock Paper Scissors Game (Using JavaScript)_ https://rosstarrant.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/
3. _Recipes Page (Using basic HTML)_ https://rosstarrant.github.io/odin-recipes/
